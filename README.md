## 🚀 Overview

The **Assiut Sheets** are a structured set of problems designed to help students master:
- Programming fundamentals  
- Logic and mathematical thinking  
- Problem-solving speed and accuracy  

Each sheet focuses on a specific topic — starting with basics like I/O and conditions, and progressing to loops, arrays, strings, and beyond.
